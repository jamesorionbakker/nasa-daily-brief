NASA DAILY BRIEF is a react based viewer for the Nasa Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API.

I built it for the shopify 2021 front end internship challenge.

Some notable features:

- back-end running in Node.js/express handles fetching of data from APOD API
- back-end utilizes server side caching which greatly reduces API requests to the nasa API.
- react based app which utilizes redux for state management
- likes perpetuated in browser local storage
- load-more button for endless exploration...
- sci-fi theme
